- This program works to create an interface to adapt the class file for the app.java.
- When file.class has the method parseFromCSV() but the other method is a parseCSV().
- Create the Object Adapter, which has the parseCSV() method, to call the method parseFromCSV().

> [!CAUTION]
> You can not run on editor. Should compile and run on cmd/terminal, cause on adapter didn't find file.class.
